### How to install

- Install an extension that lets you execute user scripts. I personally use Tampermonkey ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=es), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)).

- Copy and paste this script into a new one in your extension.
- Reload the page if you opened it previously.
